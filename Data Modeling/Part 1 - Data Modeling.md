### Independent Practice

#### Exercise 1.

Imagine you are creating a website to organize your personal recipe collection. You want to be able to:

- See the recipe name and description `ok`
- Filter by vegetarian or non-vegetarian recipes `ok`
- Sort by date added to your collection `ok`
- Filter by which meal of the day the recipe is for `ok`
- Track how many times you've made each recipe`ok`
- Find out which friend gave you this recipe (if any)`ok`

Make a data model for this app, and answer the following questions:

- What is the entity?

  Recipe / User Collection `ok`

- What are the attributes of the entity?

  Recipe - Name, Description , Reccomend by `ok`

  Collection User - Recipes Saved , Recipes Time Made, Favorites and Friends Recomendations `ok`

- What is the primary key of the entity?

  Id

- What are the data types of the attributes?

  Text

  

- Are there other ways you might model this data?

  Yes, I added some ideas.
