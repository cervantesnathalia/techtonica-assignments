https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/databases/data-modeling-2.md

### Independent Practice

#### Exercise 1

Imagine you are creating a food website that will have recipes by top chefs from around the world. The following data will be required:

- recipe name
- number of ingredients
- ingredients
- difficulty level
- cook time
- chef (who wrote the recipe)
- country (where the chef lives)
- city (where the chef lives)
- restaurants where the chef has worked
- chef's favorite ingredient

Answer the following questions:

- What are the entities?
- What are the attributes of each entity?
- What are the data types of the attributes?
- What are the relationships between the entities?
- Draw a diagram of your data model.
- Is your data model normalized? Why or why not? If not, can you change it to be normalized?
- Are there other ways you might model this data?

#### Exercise 2

- Select one of your most-used or favorite websites to click through.
- Pick one type of user flow, like buying an item.
- List the data that is required for this flow.â€¨- Organize the data into entities and attributes of each entity. Draw a diagram of your data model.

#### Exercise 3

In your own words, define the following term:

- Foreign key

What are the 3 types of database relationships? Briefly explain each one.

### Challenge

Compare your "food website" data model with another apprentice. Are there any differences between your designs? If so, for each difference try to use the data modeling principles you've learned to decide which way would be a stronger database design.
